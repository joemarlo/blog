<h2>About me, Joe Marlo </h2>

</p>

I'm a current applied statistics master's student at New York University. My advisor is [Dr. Marc Scott](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/people/marc-scott) and my current research is on sequence analysis of categorical data.

I've worked under [Dr. Jennifer Hill](https://steinhardt.nyu.edu/people/jennifer-hill), interned at Verizon in a data science role, and worked at J.P. Morgan. The majority of my latter role focused on using proprietary big data and public surveys to study the financial challenges older Americans face. I later switched roles to build a new client-facing investing platform and [robo-advisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robo-advisor) designed to serve all Americans.

Please reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jmarlo) if you have any questions or comments.
