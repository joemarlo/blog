<h2>About me, Joe Marlo </h2>

I'm a current applied statistics master's student at New York University.

I previously worked at J.P. Morgan. The majority of my work was using proprietary big data and public surveys to study the financial challenges older Americans face. I later switched roles to build a new client-facing investing platform and [robo-advisor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robo-advisor) designed to serve all Americans.
