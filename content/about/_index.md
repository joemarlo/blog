I'm a currrent applied statistics master's student at New York University.

I previously worked at J.P. Morgan. The majority of my work was using proprietary big data and public surveys to study the financial challenges older Americans face. I later switched roles to build a new client-facing investing platform and robo-advisor aimed at everyday Americans.
