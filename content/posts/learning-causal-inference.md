*Building intuition for the causal framework*
<!--more-->
***

Learning causal inference is often fraught. It is more about understanding the cognitive framework of approaching causal problems than it is about learning complex statistical equations. Many of the basic concepts lend themselves well to visualization and exploration. I have built a simple interactive tool to guide students — or any web user who is interested in causal inference — through some of these concepts. It is designed to build intuition for causal inference properties before students jump into the technical programming and analysis work themselves.

You can find the tool [here](https://jmarlo.shinyapps.io/causal-tool/).
